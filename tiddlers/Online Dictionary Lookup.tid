The below solution shows how an Online Dictionary Lookup can be created from inside Tiddlywiki.

!! Create dictionary tiddler
In a tiddler titled: [[S.S./data/dictionaryLinks]] and with its Content Type set to : `application/x-tiddler-dictionary`
put links of queries to those online dictionaries (websites) you wish to use. I have the following

>{{S.S./data/dictionaryLinks}}

!! Create macros
In a tiddler tagged with `$:/tags/Macro` , define the dictionary macro as follows:

><pre><$text text={{S.S./maro/dictionary}} /></pre>

Here the first macro `dataLinkCreator` create the query to an online dictionary and the second macro `dictionary` gets the word to lookup and create a list of links to all dictionaries existed in [[S.S./data/dictionaryLinks]]

!! Usage
It possible to directly call the dictionary macro as below

```
<<dictionary word>>
```

!! A case study
Assume some words are stored as tiddler title. It is required to show the links to online dictionaries for title word.
Here two solution are given.

# <div>

A template can be used to show the links, and the template contains the line:

```
<<dictionary {{!!title}}>>
```
The tiddler's title is simply the word itself, for example: avarice

</div>
# <div>

In another case, tiddler title is like `Word: name`, then the template line could be replaced with:

```
<$macrocall $name="dictionary" word={{{ [<currentTiddler>removeprefix[Word: ]] }}} />
```

See: [[Word: avarice]]
