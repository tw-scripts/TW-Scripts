title: Multiple Wiki and Browser Tab Management
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki
url: 

* The following linkintab macro will always open in the same browser tab, even if it is already open.
* If your links to wikis use the target parameter you can ensure you do not open the wiki more than once. 
* You are also protected if you try and reopen the tab and you have not saved previous work.
* In FireFox, if you move a tab to its own window, and click the link again it will open that windows again (and reload) - if it was minimised it will restore it.

!! Why do this?
* It allows you to keep tabs closed and open them as needed without fear of saving over the same wiki (Even without using bob)
* You can establish a Directory Wiki to other wikis that honours this reusable tabs method.
* No need to go looking for existing tabs, windows or minimised browser windows, just return to your directory, reopen if not open, reload in same tab if open (and saved)

!! Macro
Put the below script inside a tiddler and tag it with `$:/tags/Macro`

```
\define linkintab(link tabname)
<$set name=url value="$link$">
<$set name=tabname value=$tabname$>
 <a href=<<url>> target=<<tabname>> ><<tabname>></a> 
 </$set></$set>
\end
```

!! Example
```
<<linkintab "https://www.w3schools.com" W3Schools>>
<<linkintab "http://127.0.0.1:8084/"Bob>>
```

!! Remarks
In the follwing case, it is using data from a dataTiddler (the current Tiddler in a list)

```
<a href={{##wiki-url-full}}  target={{##wiki-sitetitle}}>{{$:/core/images/link}}</a>
```

And as the above macro shows the following also works

```
<a href=<<url>> target=<<tabname>> ><<tabname>></a>
```
