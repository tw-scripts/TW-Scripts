; To set a new css, what is the best solution?
# create a stylesheet tiddler? or
# put the css inside a style tag in tiddler (inline css)?

* ''Solution''
!! Use inline CSS
<<<
This is a quick and dirty solution to use custom stylesheet but the problme is the leakage! Whne a tiddler with inline css is open, the css inside it will be available to all opened tiddler and also to the wiki iteself. The below show an example

```
title: myTest
<style>
.mcls{color: red;}
</style>

<div class="mcls">This is a text in red.</div>
```
<<<

!! Use stylesheet tiddler
<<<
This is the recommended solution. In this way you create a tiddler and tag it with `$:\tags\Stylesheet` and put your css code inside. This css is available to all tiddler and the whole wiki. Opening the tiddler has no effect. As an example see below code

```
title: myCSS
tag:   $:/tags/Stylesheet

.mcls{color: red;}
```
In any other tiddler you can use the css in above tiddler. For example

```
title: myTest
<div class="mcls">This is a text in red.</div>
```

<<alert danger "''Don't use inline css'' (using style tag inside normal tiddlers) as much as possible. They have the risk of unwanted leak">>
