; Why blank filter in list does not execute the emptyMessage?

The TW parser doesn't differentiate between a parameter with a ''blank value'' and a parameter that ''is not specified'' at all.  Thus, since `filter=""`, it's as if you had just written

<$macrocall 
  $name="wikitext-example-without-html" 
src="""<$set name="myVariable" filter="" value="It's magic" emptyValue="It's not magic">
<$text text=<<myVariable>> />
</$set>
""" />
