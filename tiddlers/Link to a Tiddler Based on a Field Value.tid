;How to create a link to a tiddler based on field value?
: Use a macro with a filter to limit the results to specific filed

!! Example
Assume you wish to make links to tiddler based a field called `id`. Put the below macro inside a tiddler and tagged it with `$:/tags/Macro`

```
\define linkto(idval)
<$list filter="[field:id[$idval$]!has[draft.of]limit[1]]"/>
\end
```

!! Remarks
* The macro gets an idval as input parameter
* The `list` widget uses the filter `field:if[keyword]` to search and list all tiddlers have a field `id` wich its contant is `keyword`
* The `list` widget then limits the output to one and make an internal link as output

;Note
: If there are several tiddlers having the same value in their `id` field then all of them are the answer and macro will return a link to the first item found. To prevent this, use uique id value.
