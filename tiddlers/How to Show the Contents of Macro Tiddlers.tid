title: How to Show the Contents of Macro Tiddlers
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

By default all macros are hidden in view mode. 

Sometimes you have a tiddler tagged with `$:/tags/Macro` which contains global macro and you want to see the code in the view mode, to have so, simply add the following lines as the last line of text.

```
<pre><$view field="text"/></pre>
```
