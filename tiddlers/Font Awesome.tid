!! Discussion
There is a discussion at [[Forume|https://groups.google.com/d/msg/tiddlywiki/wp0pY_Aervc/Pg-svkruAwAJ]]. The Font awesome 5.0 has a folder containing the svg files so they can be imported and used as single file in TW.
See the below recommendations

! Using fontawesome svg with TW 
Ref: [[Josiah|https://groups.google.com/d/msg/tiddlywiki/wp0pY_Aervc/vXcFkyAQBAAJ]]

For the FontAwesome SVGs, used as is, I would set width="auto" height="22pt" In fact you can leave width out entirely as "auto" is implied. The reason is that FA SVGs have a "viewBox" that is normally 512 high but can come in variant widths.

And the 22 "points" height is when you want the the same height as icons in TW as the core icons are all (I think) 22pt x 22pt (viewBox="0 0 128 128") -- i.e square. 

SVGs can be confusing at first as the dimensions are not exactly the apparent "image" size. The width and height are actually a scaling in relation to the viewBox.

NOW, if you want square icons, like they are in TW, you could force the FA SVG to reshape by using `width="22pt"` `height="22pt"` and adding `preserveAspectRatio="none"`. I suspect many of the FA SVGs will reshape well. Anyway, IMO its better interface icons are the same size :-)

Here's an example of how the start could look for an FA SVG for a TW icon ...

```
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 448 512" width="22pt" height="22pt" preserveAspectRatio="none">
```
