The below macro was introduced by {{!!responder}} to create a filter to compare two numbers and return the bigger one

```
\define gt(a, b) $a$ $b$ +[nsort[]last[1]remove[$b$]]
```

!! Remarks
* `a`, `b`' two number as input parameters
* `gt` filter will return `a`, if it is greater than `b`

Based on this idea, the below macro is developed to return the smaller number

```
\define lt(a, b) $a$ $b$ +[nsort[]first[1]remove[$b$]]
```

!! Remarks
* `a`, `b`' two number as input parameters
* `lt` filter will return `a`, if it is less than `b`
