; How display conditionally the content of any tiddler tagged with `erlang_code` as a code with a compile button?
: A conditional viewtemplate, a stylesheet is needed as described below

#<div>

Create a tiddler tagged with `$:/tags/Viewtemplate` contains what is planned to be displayed conditionally, here it is planned to show a button and its text as a code.

```
<$list filter="[is[current]tag[erlang_code]]">
<button>Compile</button>
<pre>{{!!text}}</pre>
</$list>
```
</div>
#<div>

Here there is a problem. It is that the custom ViewTemplate doesn't ''replace'' the standard view... it //ADDS// to it to the end of the standard view.  Thus, you see the tiddler content twice: first as standard wikitext output (the normal tiddler display) then followed by your custom-formatted output.

To get the results you want, you need to suppress the standard output... but only when the tiddler is tagged "erlang_code".

One quick way to achieve this is to use CSS to hide the standard tiddler "body" element.  Just put the following CSS into a tiddler tagged with `$:/tags/Stylesheet`:

```
[data-tags*="erlang_code"] .tc-tiddler-body { display:none; }
```
</div>
#<div>

Now create any tiddler you want and tag it with `erlang_code` and see the result. An example is given here.

<<list-links "[tag[exmp16]] -[<currentTiddler>]">>
</div>
