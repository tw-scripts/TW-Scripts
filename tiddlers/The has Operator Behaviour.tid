; What are the differences between these two filters:
# `[has[fieldname]]` and
# `[has:field[fieldname]]`

Assume you have used above filters inside a `$list` widget as below:

```
Case I:
<$list filter="[has[fieldname]]" variable="v">
<<v>>
</$list>
```
and

```
Case I:
<$list filter="[has:field[fieldname]]" variable="v">
<<v>>
</$list>
```
The differences are as below:

<<<
* Both cases returns nothing (empty `v`) if the field does not exist.
* Both cases return the same result is the field exist and is //NOT EMPTY//.
* Case I returns nothing (empty `v`) if the field //EXIST// but is //EMPTY//.
* Case II returns the tiddler title if the field //EXIST// but is //EMPTY//.

!! Remark
In [[has operator|https://groups.google.com/d/msg/tiddlywiki/PiUwdVpdyzQ/OwsKmr6TEgAJ]] on Tiddlywiki, it has been explained that:

* `has` operator can be used with a suffix
* the `value` suffix is equivalent to no suffix
** `[has[myfield]]` or `[has:value[myfield]` are the same
** result is: those input tiddlers in which field has a //non-empty value//
* the `field` suffix
** result: those input tiddlers in which //field exists//
