;What is _canonical_uri?
: It lets you wrap an external tiddler into a tiddler so that you can refer to it more easily.

!! Example
For example, create a tiddler titled ''MyImage'' with the type `image/jpeg` and the `_canonical_uri` field set to ''images\anatomy.jpg''. Then you can embed it as an image with `[img[MyImage]]` or `{{MyImage}}`.

The advantage of using it is that you can subsequently change the URL of the image just by changing it in a single place.
