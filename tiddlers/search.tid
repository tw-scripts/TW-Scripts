Search filter operator is a powerful feature in Tiddlywiki lets you to look for information stored in tiddlers. It can search all fields and from TW 5.1.18 supports extended syntax.

<<<From: [[Tiddlywiki.com|https://tiddlywiki.com/#search%20Operator]]

```
[search:<field list>:<flag list>[<operand>]]
```
* ''field list'': a comma delimited list of field names to restrict the search
** defaults to <<.field tags>>, <<.field text>> and <<.field title>> if blank
** an asterisk `*` instead of the field list causes the search to be performed across all fields available on each tiddler
** preceding the list with a minus sign `-` reverses the order so that the search is performed on all fields except the listed fields
* ''flag list'': a comma delimited list of flags (defaults to `words` if blank)
* ''operand'': filter operand
