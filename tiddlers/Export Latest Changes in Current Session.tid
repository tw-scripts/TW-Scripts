`haschanged[]` will list all tiddlers since the last time the wiki was loaded from disk, ie the reload button, or if you close the tab and reopen again.

It is perfect for an ''emergency save'', like list everything changed since I loaded it this morning. Export to JSON, restore from last working version and import the json.

!! Example
# Open the <<advanced-search>>
# Choose the `Filter` tab
# Enter the below filter `[haschanged[]!prefix[$:/state]!prefix[$:/temp]![$:/StoryList]![$:/HistoryList]]`
# Click on export tiddler icon on the right side
# Save as JSON file

You can import this JSON later into a wiki file.
