{{||toc}}
TiddlyWiki is an open-source single page application wiki. A single HTML file contains CSS, JavaScript, and the content. The content is divided into a series of components, or Tiddlers. A user is encouraged to read a TiddlyWiki by following links rather than sequentially scrolling down the page.



!Tiddlers

TiddlyWiki content is divided into a series of components called tiddlers. Each tiddler is stored inside an HTML division that contains the source text and meta data in wiki markup. For example, the following could be the HTML source code for the beginning of this section written as a tiddler:

```
<div title="Tiddlers" 
    modifier="John Smith" 
    created="200811132220" 
    modified="200811132225" 
    changecount="3" 
    tags="wikipedia section example code">
      <pre>TiddlyWiki content is divided into a ...
```

!Plugins

In addition to containing text, a tiddler can be a plugin with additional JavaScript and CSS to extend TiddlyWiki. As a result, TiddlyWiki is used in a wide variety of adaptations and uses beyond that of a personal wiki.

!File saving

A TiddlyWiki opened from a file URI may save changes made back to the original file using one of the following techniques:

*    formerly the Mozilla File I/O [2] under the control of the UniversalXPConnect per-file preferences [3] for Mozilla Firefox. That functionality was removed from Firefox, and is now replaced with a plugin called TiddlyFox.
*    the Microsoft ActiveX FileSystemObject [4] for Internet Explorer
*    TiddlySaver Java applet to extend Safari, Opera, Chrome/Chromium, and other browsers. Requires the Java runtime.

!Applications

Although there are many TiddlyWiki documents on the Web, the majority of TiddlyWikis reside on personal computers and are exchanged on USB flash drives and over email, in a manner similar to word processing documents and spreadsheets. It has been suggested that, as a single HTML file, or saved as an HTA file in Microsoft Windows (allowing corporate IE lockdown to be bypassed), TiddlyWiki is useful in corporate environments where red tape or IT resources might prevent the use of a wiki that requires a more complicated installation.[5]

TiddlyWiki has been used as a Software framework to build specialisations. SocialText uses TiddlyWiki as a part of their unplugged feature.[6]

!History

*    The first version of TiddlyWiki was released by Jeremy Ruston in September 2004.
*    BT Group bought Osmosoft in 2007[7][8] appointing Ruston as BT's "Head of Open Source Innovation".[9]
*    TiddlyWiki was selected as one of the Top 100 Tools for 2007 and 2008 by the Centre for Learning & Performance Technologies.[10]
*    In November 2011, Jeremy Ruston announced his departure from Osmosoft and commitment to continue development on TiddlyWiki.[11][12] He is currently building a new TiddlyWiki called TiddlyWiki 5 from the ground up based on lessons learned from the first versions. A beta version was released mid December 2013.[13]
