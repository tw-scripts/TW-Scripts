; How to create a button to navigate to the previous tiddler in story river?
: In Tiddlywiki `$:/StoryList` keeps the title of all tiddlers are open in the current story. So it is simple to use the `action-navigate` to go back to the previous tiddler.

!! Code
Put the below code in a tiddler and tag it with `$:/tags/ViewTemplate`

```
<$button> 
<$list filter="[all[current]previous[$:/StoryList]]">
<$action-navigate $to=<<currentTiddler>> />
</$list>Open Previous Tiddler
</$button>
```

In the above script:

* The `$list` widget search the `$:/StoryList` and returns the previous tiddler in the list based on the current tiddler.
* It then used the `action-navigate` to go to the previous tiddler (stored in `currentTiddler` variable)
