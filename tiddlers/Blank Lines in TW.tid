; How important are blank lines in wikitext?
: Blank lines cause different mode of output (block mode or inline mode)

!! Block mode versus inline mode 
 To get the content of an HTML element to be parsed in block mode, the opening tag must be followed by two linebreaks.

Without the two linebreaks, the tag content will be parsed in inline mode which means that block mode formatting such as wikitext tables, lists and headings is not recognised.
