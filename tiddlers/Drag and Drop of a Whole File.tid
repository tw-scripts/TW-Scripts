title: Drag and Drop of a Whole File
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

All tiddler links are draggable by default. They can be dragged within a browser window for manipulating tiddlers, or dragged to a different browser window to initiate an import operation

If you drag-and-drop a whole wiki file (a Tiddlywiki file e.g. //mywiki.html//) over another wiki, an [[import operation|https://tiddlywiki.com/#Importing%20Tiddlers]] will be inititaed

This way you can also update old wiki files. Assume you have an //empty.html// of new release. If you drag and drop your old wiki file over the //empty.html//, TW will import all tiddlers except the newer system (core, plugin) tiddlers.

!! Example
# Open an empty.html (can be downloaded from: https://tiddlywiki.com/#GettingStarted)
# Open it in a browser
# Drag your old wiki over it
# Choose which tiddlers you would like to be imported
# Save your empty.html
That's all.
