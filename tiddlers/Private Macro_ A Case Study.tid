title: Private Macro: A Case Study
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

!! Sub macros
Assume three are three macros, tow of them work as sub-macro (like sub-function or private methods in other programming language) for the main macro.

<<<
```
\define smac1(a)  This is $a$
\define smac2(b)  and she lives in $b$.

\define myMac(x,y)
<<smac1 $x$>> <<smac2 $y$>>
\end
```
<<<

The first two macro should not be available globally as they are sub-macro and only used by `myMac` here. How to have `myMac` globally accessible prevent the access to first two macros?

!! Solution
#<div>

The first two macros are put in a tiddler with a custom tag say `myCode`

* Title: [[Example 36: Private Macro]]
* Tag: `mycode`
* Text: as below
<<<
```
\define smac1(a)  This is $a$
\define smac2(b)  and she lives in $b$.
```
<<<
</div>
#<div>

The third macro `myMac` should be put in a tiddler tagged with `$:/tags/Macro` to be globally available. Beause it needs the first two macros and they are not accessible, then it is required to import them as below

* Title: [[Example 36: Global Macro]]
* Tag: `$:/tags/Macro`
* Text: as below
<<<
```
\define myMac(x,y)
\import [tag[myCode]]
<<smac1 """$x$""">> <<smac2 """$y$""">>
\end
```
<<<

It is also possible to use the `importvariables` widget as below

* Title: [[Example 36: Global Macro]]
* Tag: `$:/tags/Macro`
* Text: as below
<<<
```
\define myMac(x,y)
<$importvariables filter="[tag[myCode]]">
<<smac1 """$x$""">> <<smac2 """$y$""">>
</$importvariables>
\end
```
<<<
</div>

!! See example in action
!!! Call global macro
<$macrocall $name="wikitext-example-without-html" 
src="""><<myMac "Bugs Bunny" "Rabbit Hole Hill">>"""/>

!!! Call private macro. 
<$macrocall $name="wikitext-example-without-html" 
src="""<<smac1 "Bugs Bunny">>
<<smac2 "Rabbit Hole Hill">>
"""/>

<<alert warning "''Note'': No output by private macro `smac1` and `smac2`, because they are NOT globally accessible.">>
