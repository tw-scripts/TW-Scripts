title: Create External Images from A Directory

; Assume you have a folder on Windows drive contains images, how to add these images to wiki as external images?

Using an advanced text editor like Emacs, get a list of your images and put it into a format like this:

```
cimg2199.jpg: x
cimg2200.jpg: x
cimg2201.jpg: x
cimg2202.jpg: x
```

Paste this into a tiddler called "MyImages" and change the type to data dictionary. Save the tiddler.

Create another tiddler with the following contents:

```
\define gluepath() $(path)$$(image)$
<$set name="path" value="file:///D:\data\graphics\file-us\">

<$button>Make Image Tiddlers
<$list filter="[[MyImages]indexes[]]" variable="image">
<$action-createtiddler $basetitle=<<image>> _canonical_uri=<<gluepath>> type="image/jpeg">
</$list>
</$button>

</$set>
```

Change the "path" variable to whatever address is needed for image directory and system (I used `file:///` but you don't need that for images positioned relative to your system).

Click on the "Make Image Tiddlers" button, and a "Image Tiddler" (_canonical_uri based) will be made for each image. 

You can of course play with this to use other image dictionaries, paths, etc. A similar technque could be used to generate image wikitext if you don't like Image Tiddlers. Note that if you are on windows that you can't use drive names like C: in the data dictionary (that's why I applied the path outside the dictionary).

!!! Example
See TW-Images there are examples there using this technique
