Chris Hunt did a nice walkthrough a few years ago:

Bonus - it’s made with v5.0.7, which now seems ancient. But not much has changed since then, so I’d expect the material to still work.

Alternatively, you could read through some of the core widgets in reverse order of complexity.

The “text" widget is a good place to start; it just renders a string of text provided as an attribute:

The “codeblock” is marginally more complex: it renders a `<code>/<pre>` pair to contain it’s rendered children:

The “vars” widget introduces variable assignments:

https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/blob/master/core/modules/widgets/vars.js

The “count” widget is a good example of a simple widget with a slightly more complicated refresh strategy: it only refreshes itself if the count has changed:

https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/blob/master/core/modules/widgets/count.js

Finally, the “keyboard” widget is a simple example of a widget with an event handler:
