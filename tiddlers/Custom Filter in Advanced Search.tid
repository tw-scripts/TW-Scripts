title: Custom Filter in Advanced Search

To add your own filters to the list of advanced search filters (drop down menu):

# create a new tiddler (e.g. `SomeName`) tagged with `$:/tags/Filter`
# add a `description` field containing "My Filter")
# add a `filter` field containing `[search:text[MYSEARCHTEXT]]`)
# add a `list-before` field (leave it with a blank value)

* the tag indicates that this is an entry for the filter drop-down.
* the description is the text that appears in the drop-down.
* the filter is the text to insert into the filter input field when the drop-down item is selected
* the list-before field (with NO value) forces your custom filter to * the top of the list (otherwise it would be at the end of the list)
