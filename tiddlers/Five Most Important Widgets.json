At the beginning we didn’t have flexible enough primitives to model some behaviour (like the story river), and so there’s a number of widgets that encapsulate blobs of JavaScript that could soon be replaced by more generic, smaller components: \n\n* `<$navigator>` \n* `<$fieldmangler>` \n* `<$linkcatcher>` \n* `<$encrypt>` for encrypting the payload of standalone HTML TiddlyWikis \n* `<$raw>` ",
