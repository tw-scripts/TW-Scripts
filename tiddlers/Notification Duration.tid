Notifications are small informational messages that appear at the top right of the TiddlyWiki window, and automatically disappear after a preset time. How is it possible the preset time to about 15 s.

!! Solution
There is an internal JavaScript setting for the notification duration. It can be changed with this one liner:

```
title: $:/_ChangeNotificationDuration
module-type: startup
type: application/javascript

$tw.config.preferences.notificationDuration = 15 * 1000;
```

This is a the code
$:/_ChangeNotificationDuration
