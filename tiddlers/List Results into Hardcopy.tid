;How is it possible to write down the result of filtered list into another tiddler as harcopy (static text)?

I'd like to make a button that allows me to create a "hard copy" of the list into a tiddler in the sense that you could open the tiddler file in another program and just see the list there, i.e. in the form of a normal text file.

!! Solution
The below code list all tiddler' tagged with `Learning` and then uses a button to write their conents into a tiddler called `myErrands` as a harcopy (static text).

```
\define mymegatext()
<$list filter="[tag[Learning]limit[20]]">
<$view field=text/>
</$list>
\end
\define mybutton()
<$wikify name=mytext text=<<mymegatext>>>
<$action-setfield 
$tiddler="myErrands"
   tags="hardcopies"
text=<<mytext>>
/>
</$wikify>

\end

<$button actions=<<mybutton>> >
set Errands
</$button>
```

This way it is possible to merge several tiddlers into one. Like merging all tiddlers tagged with `$:/tags/Stylesheet` and export the resulted tiddler to compress using a CSS online minifier.
