So I assume that the most optimized filters for your queries would work like:\n\n```\n[search:title[foo]search:text[bar]]\n```\nIn the above snippet, all tiddlers have foo in their titles and bar in their text will be shown!\n\n\n!!! Example\n```\n{{{[search:title[kookma]search:text[rb]]}}}\n```\n\n{{{[search:title[kookma]search:text[rb]]}}}\n",
