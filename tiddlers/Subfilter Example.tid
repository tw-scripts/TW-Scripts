; How and where subfilter is used?
Imagine you want to dynamically create filters. You can obviously use macro definitions and use them like

```
filter=<<mymacro>>
```

Issue arises when you want to add steps to the filter. You cannot go

```
filter="<<mymacro>> +[tag[mytag]]"
```

Subfilter solves this issue. You can go like 

```
filter="[subfilter<mymacro>] +[tag[mytag]]"
```

And in another tiddler you can go like 

```
filter="[subfilter<mymacro>append[!]]"
```

Basically it enables you to define dynamic filters and reuse them.
