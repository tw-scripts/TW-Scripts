; How to display list of tiddlers tagged with parent tiddler, when it is opened?
: Use conditional view template.

!! Example
The below template is show all tiddlers tagged with the parent tiddler as an ordered list:

* It checks to see if there is any tiddler tagged with the current tiddler (parent). This is performed by the outer `list` widget.
* It then makes a call to `list-links` macro to display the tiddlers using an ordered list.
* A short message is also showed indication tiddlers tagged with the parent tiddler.

<pre><$view tiddler="viewtemplate/tagging"/></pre>

<$macrocall $name="alert" type="danger" text="""''Note'': Reffering to paranet tiddler by `<<currentTiddler>>` in the text is problematic. Using the double angle brackets syntax in the open like this causes the text in the target variable to be wikified. Thus, if you had a tiddler called "HelloThere Jeremy" the word "HelloThere" would be turned into a link to a different tiddler."""/>
