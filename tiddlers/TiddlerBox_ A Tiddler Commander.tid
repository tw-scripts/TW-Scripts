I am thinking on having a Tiddler Commander to do the below jobs in one place.

These are kind of batch (bulk) operation and work on a group of tiddlers or a bunch of tiddlers.
A bunch of tiddlers is a group of tiddlers meet some criteria like having a common tag, common filed, have a common word in their title, created the same day, or month or year and like that.

!! The bulk operation:
# Rename tiddlers
# use  a totally new name
# add a suffix/prefix to title
# add prefix to title
# replace part of title
# add ordinal number to title 
# Copy tiddlers (make duplicates)
# Add/remove tag or any field
# Change/replace the content of any field
# Create empty bulk tiddlers (for lecture or slideshow) having common properties (tag, field, part of text,...)
# Capability to undo the operation at least one step
# Capability to get the user confirmation before doing the operation

I want to have this minimal, simple to work and simple to understand.

//I Know Most of These Tools are Already Developed// and I need to collect the best of them.

I appreciate to have your comments/opinion on this tool. I appreciate who knows or has these tools to share them.

As there are expert Tiddliwikians in this forum, I appreciate if anybody else can help, manage or do the job.
