HTML bookmarks are used to allow readers to jump to specific parts of a Web page. Bookmarks can be useful if your webpage is very long. To make a bookmark, you must first create the bookmark, and then add a link to it. When the link is clicked, the page will scroll to the location with the bookmark.

It seems it possible to make a bookmark in TW.

!! Create a bookmark
First create a bookmark using `id`

```
<h2 id="C4">Chapter 4</h2>
```

!! Then, add a link to the bookmark
(Jump to Chapter 4), from within the same page



```
<$link href="#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</$link>
```

<$link href="#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</$link>
