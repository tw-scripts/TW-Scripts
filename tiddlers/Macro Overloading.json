        "text": "<<< [[Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_overloading]]\nIn some programming languages, function overloading or method overloading is the ability to create multiple functions of the same name with different implementations. Calls to an overloaded function will run a specific implementation of that function appropriate to the context of the call, allowing one function call to perform different tasks depending on context. \n<<<\n\n;What is macro overloading in TiddlyWiki?\n: If a macro is called in a scope one (e.g inside a tiddler) and the macro itself calls another macro (a second macro) internally say //maymac//, then if this second macro  //maymac// is existed in the scope of calling tiddler, it will override the core or other scope macro! This is macro overloading.\n\nA good example is the `toc-caption` macro. For more information see Jeremy Ruston explanation [[here|https://groups.google.com/d/msg/tiddlywiki/sZNfQBxMs3c/eOXiDEFxDAAJ]].\n\n!! Example\nA set of macros has been defined in [[exmp43/macro/overloading]] as follows:\n\n> <pre><$view tiddler=\"exmp43/macro/overloading\" /></pre>\nIf the macro `mac-xx` is called the expected output is as below:\n\n<<<\n<<mac-yy>>\n<<<\n\nNow, consider it is called from [[Example 43: Macro Overloading]] which itself has an internal macro with the same name `mac-xx` as defined in [[exmp43/macro/overloading]].\n\n><pre><$view tiddler=\"Example 43: Macro Overloading\"/></pre>\n\nStrangely the out is as bellow:\n\n>{{Example 43: Macro Overloading}}\n\nWhat happened is, in the second case there is a `mac-xx` defined inside [[Example 43: Macro Overloading]], so TW overloads the original macro with this one.",
