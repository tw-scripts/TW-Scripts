title: Change the Order of Tiddlers
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Many widgets and macro in Tiddlywiki use the tiddler order to display their results. Examples are

* tabs macro (e.g `<<tabs "[tag[mytag]]">>` )
* toc macro (e.g `<<toc "[tag[mytag]]">>` )

The simplest way to chnage the order of tiddlers is:

# Simply open one of the tiddler tagged say with `mytag`
# Click on the tag-pill
# Reorder the tiddlers in the drop down menu by dragging and droping

!! Alternative solution
# Use the tag macro whenever you want as below
#* `<<tag mytag>>`
# A tag-pill will be created
# Click on the tag-pill
# Reorder the tiddlers in the drop down menu by dragging and droping

! Example
Click on the below tag pill and change the order of tiddlers.

><<tag "exmp20">>
