title: How Use Now Macro inside a Filter

How to list (with list-links) everything tagged with "myTag" that also begins with the current year and month (specifically in the format "YYYY.0MM.")

* Solution
<<<
Use a set widget and first store your desired date into a varaibale. Here the current year and month can be generated using the `now` macro as `<<now YYYY.0MM.>>`. Other date formats can also be used.

```
<$set name="mydate" value=<<now YYYY.0MM.>> >
<<list-links "[tag[myTag]prefix<mydate>]">>
</$set>
```
