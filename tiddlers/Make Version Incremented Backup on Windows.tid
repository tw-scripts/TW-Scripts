title: Make Version Incremented Backup on Windows
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki
url: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/tiddlywiki/j28oUuw5x3A/du8r_yLGCQAJ

The below code uses robocopy to create a version-incremented copies of files (here tiddlers)

The script:

* always create an identical copy of source tiddlers
* create version-incremented copies of all files differ from their source (you may change a tiddler in source or backup folder)
* version number started from 000 ~ 999, so this is maximum number of versions
* use robocopy which is very fast method for creating backups
* 
!! How to use
* change the source and destination folders to meet your case
* run the batch file

```
:: Ref: https://www.experts-exchange.com/questions/23427327/How-to-use-Robocopy-to-create-files-Versions.html
:: Running the script will first Robocopy any files which don't already exist in the destination,
:: then use xcopy to create version-incremented copies of any files which do exist in the destination.
