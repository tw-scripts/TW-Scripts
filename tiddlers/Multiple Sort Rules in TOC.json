How can you apply a separate sort order to just those sub-items tagged Journal?\n\nThe trick is to add a field to the parent tagging tiddler (i.e. `Journal`) that points to a different sort criteria. Let's call the field `fuzzy`, and populate it with the value `created` (created is the name of the field that contains a tiddler's creation date).\n\nNow change your Table of Contents to look like this:\n\n```\n<<toc-selective-expandable  \"TableOfContents\" \"sort{!!fuzzy}\" >>\n```\n\n!!
